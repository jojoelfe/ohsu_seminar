# Cryo-EM imaging of biomolecular complexes in their native environment

From the rare mechanosensory transduction complex to the abundant ribosome

# Why Cryo-EM?

- Electrons can be accelerated to hundreds of keV, wavelength that are much
  smaller than atomic radii

- We can produce highly coherent electron beams and stable and tunable lenses
  for electrons exists

# But...

- Vitrification perfectly preserves the interior of cells

- But:

- High energy electrons rapidly damage biological samples => Noisy images

- Biomolecules have very little contrast comparent to solvent

# So we don't see this, but this:

Question?

# Today: Two strategies to find molecules in these images

- Tomography with AuNP

- 2DTM on entire cell sections
