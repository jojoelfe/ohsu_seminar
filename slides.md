# Finding the needle in the haystack

## Detecting molecules in Cryo-EM images of cells

### Johannes Elferich

### 10/19/2022

# Why Cryo-EM?

- Electrons can be accelerated to hundreds of keV, wavelength that are much
  smaller than atomic radii

- We can produce highly coherent electron beams and stable and tunable lenses
  for electrons exists

- Vitrification perfectly preserves the interior of cells

- But:

- High energy electrons rapidly damage biological samples => Noisy images

- Biomolecules have very little contrast comparent to solvent

# So we don't see this, but this:
