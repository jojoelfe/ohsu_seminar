# Cryo-EM imaging of biomolecular complexes in their native environment

From the rare mechanosensory transduction complex to the abundant ribosome

# Why Cryo-EM?

::left::

- Electrons can be accelerated to hundreds of keV, wavelength that are much
  smaller than atomic radii

- Electrons can be manipulated using electric and magnetic fields, making

![Real EM](trueem.png)

- High energy electrons rapidly damage biological samples => Noisy images

- Biomolecules have very little contrast comparent to solvent

- No 3D, just a projection

- Small field of view
